## Experiment: Artificial Gene Regulatory Network, Multivariate Polynomial Regression

We propose an Artificial Gene Regulatory Network (Artificial Protein Network) with nodes that
performs second-degree polynomials and layers with few connections each other;
when nodes are put together, they are trainable by gradient descent algorithms
and can represent any higher-degree multivariate polynomial dynamical system
similarly to complex biological dynamical systems.
